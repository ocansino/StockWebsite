    <p>
      At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path. In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

South African entrepreneur Elon Musk is known for founding Tesla Motors and SpaceX, which launched a landmark commercial spacecraft in 2012.
Who Is Elon Musk?
Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. 

Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.

In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.

Early Life
Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.

At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.

In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.

Family
Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family.

Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.

Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.

Education
At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.

In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.

After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

<h5>
  Zip2 Corporation
    </h5>
    <p>
Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.
    </p>
<h5>
  PayPal
    </h5>
    <p>
In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.

In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.
    </p>
<h5>
  SpaceX
    </h5>
    <p>
Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.

  <h3>
    Warren Buffet
    </h3>
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/eaebff2d-b47c-4358-8711-d81cf2ca28cb/waren.jpg?v=1639637384640" class = "waren"</img>
    <p>
      Buffett enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 16 to study business. He stayed two years, moved to the University of Nebraska to finish up his degree, and emerged from college at age 20 with nearly $10,000 from his childhood businesses.

In 1951 he received his master's degree in economics at Columbia University, where he studied under economist Benjamin Graham and furthered his education at the New York Institute of Finance.

Influenced by Graham's 1949 book, The Intelligent Investor, Buffett sold securities for Buffett-Falk & Company for three years, before working for his mentor for two years as an analyst at Graham-Newman Corp.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 1956 Buffet formed the firm Buffett Partnership Ltd. in his hometown of Omaha. Utilizing the techniques learned from Graham, he was successful in identifying undervalued companies and became a millionaire. One such enterprise Buffett valued was a textile company named Berkshire Hathaway. He began accumulating stock in the early 1960s, and by 1965 he had assumed control of the company.

Despite the success of Buffett Partnership, its founder dissolved the firm in 1969 to focus on the development of Berkshire Hathaway. He phased out its textile manufacturing division, instead expanding the company by buying assets in media (The Washington Post), insurance (GEICO) and oil (Exxon). Immensely successful, the "Oracle of Omaha" even managed to spin seemingly poor investments into gold, most notably with his purchase of scandal-plagued Salomon Brothers in 1987.

Following Berkshire Hathaway's significant investment in Coca-Cola, Buffett became director of the company from 1989 until 2006. He has also served as director of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings, Graham Holdings Company and The Gillette Company.

    <h3>
      Kevin O'Leary
    </h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/eaebff2d-b47c-4358-8711-d81cf2ca28cb/kevin.jpg?v=1639637346281" class = "kevin"</img>
    <p>
      O’Leary was the son of a salesman and a clothing manufacturer. After the death of his father, he spent time in the United States and Cambodia, where his stepfather was a student and a United Nations worker, respectively. O’Leary earned a bachelor’s degree in environmental studies from the University of Waterloo in 1977 and an M.B.A. degree from the University of Western Ontario (now known as Western University) in 1980. With two partners he formed Special Event Television, a company that produced sports programming. As a producer, he worked for the flamboyant Canadian hockey announcer Don Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
In 1983, in Toronto, O’Leary cofounded a company called SoftKey Software Products, Inc. SoftKey acquired many producers of educational software, and during the early 1990s it was reputed to be one of Canada’s fastest-growing companies. After reaching an agreement in 1995 to buy the California-based Learning Company, SoftKey assumed the Learning Company name. The Learning Company was sold to the American toy maker Mattel in 1999 for more than $3 billion, but the acquisition turned out to be hugely unprofitable for Mattel, and O’Leary soon left the combined company. In 2008 he set up a mutual fund called O’Leary Funds, which he sold in 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
O’Leary began his rise to celebrity status in 2006, when he took a place on a panel of venture capitalists that passed judgment on hopeful entrepreneurs for the CBC reality show Dragons’ Den. Starting in 2009, he filled the same role on ABC’s Shark Tank, the U.S. version of the same program. He also appeared as a commentator for the Canadian television channel Business News Network.
    </p>
    <p>
In January 2017 O’Leary announced his candidacy for leadership of Canada’s Conservative Party. As a prospective politician with a background in business and television, but not government, he reminded some observers of U.S. Pres. Donald Trump. Although he quickly became a front-runner, O’Leary dropped out of the race in April, claiming that he would be unable to win the 2019 general election.
